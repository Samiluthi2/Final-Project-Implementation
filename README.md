## Read Me!
- A description of your project
  - My project is an To Do Application, its goal is to track peoples tasks and if the user has successfully completed a task, it will then Congratulate them. If not, then user can delete it or clear the tasks they have. The To Do Application also checks if you try to delete a task without selecting it and will prompt you to do so, or if you try to clear all tasks when you have none
  
- Instructions on configuration and execution of your project
  - Just open application and write task you plan to complete, and then press add. Doing so will add the task into a ViewList. And from there once you complete or give up on task you can select task and press Done, Delete, or Clear All.
  
- A description of your repository and overall software design 
  - -My Repository is seperated into Main, Controller, and obviously the fxml file. I'd say that the overall software design is well, but may be messy as there were alot of testing, failing, but also succeeding. I think that seperating the controller from main made it much more cleaner though and made thinking better.

- Challenges
  - I'd say the challenges I've faced were implementing what i learned into new libraries and key terms, as shown above when i did not know the 1 line code to clear all from ViewList, I'd also say though that I've improved with my skill of Java and using a GUI, this feels really nice to actually create something from nothing, and stuff i can show my family and be proud of. I also think it's really cool because this is the beginning of my Programming journey so it's nice to see where i started from, to where i will be.
